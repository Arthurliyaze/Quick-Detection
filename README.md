# Quick-Detection
**Codes for Quick Detection Projects during PhD.**\
The "Sparse_FDI" folder contains codes to reproduce the detection algorithm in paper [*"Low Latency Detection of Sparse False
Data Injections in Smart Grids"*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8485421).\
The "DQN_detection" folder contains source code of the detection algorithm in paper [*Low Latency Cyberattack Detection in 
Smart Grids with Deep Reinforcement Learning*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142061522002897). Citation:
